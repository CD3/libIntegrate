  * This is an empty class that should be specialized for different orders of integration.
  * The specializations should derive from the detail::GaussLegendreQuadrature_imp and
  * passes themselves as template parameter (CRTP). detail::GaussLegendreQuadrature_imp
  * expects there to be a getX and getW function that return std::arrays<T,Order> references
  * to the weight and abscissa. The function should create and return static arrays so that
  * these arrays are only created once for each order.

Use this directory to store external projects that your project depends on. For example, if your
project depends on libMPE, you could keep the libMPE repo here.

You can manage your external dependencies however you want, but if you are going to make edits to the
external project that you will want to commit "upstream", you should use a tool like
[`git-subrepo`](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo)

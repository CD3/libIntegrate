# C++ library for numerical integration

`libIntegrate` is a collection of algorithms for doing numerical integration.

# Description

When writing numerical simulations, one often needs to integrate some function, or an approximation of some function.
This library implements several common integration algorithms in C++. It is not as sophisticated, or complete, as
the Gnu Scientific Library (https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), Numerical Recipes (http://numerical.recipes/), or QUADPACK (http://www.netlib.org/quadpack/),
but it is released under a permissive license, and you are free to do whatever you want with it.
